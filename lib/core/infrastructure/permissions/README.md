# Infrastructure Layer - Permissions

This directory contains infrastructure-level permission management services.

## Purpose

The infrastructure layer provides cross-cutting concerns that support the domain and data layers. Permission management is a critical infrastructure component that should be available throughout the application.

## Migration Notes

This directory will contain permission services migrated from `core/permissions/` as part of the architecture improvement plan.
