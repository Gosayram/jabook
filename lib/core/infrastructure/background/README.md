# Infrastructure Layer - Background Tasks

This directory contains infrastructure-level background task services.

## Purpose

The infrastructure layer provides cross-cutting concerns that support the domain and data layers. Background tasks are a critical infrastructure component that should be available throughout the application.

## Migration Notes

This directory will contain background task services migrated from `core/background/` as part of the architecture improvement plan.
