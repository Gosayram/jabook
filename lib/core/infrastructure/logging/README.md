# Infrastructure Layer - Logging

This directory contains infrastructure-level logging services.

## Purpose

The infrastructure layer provides cross-cutting concerns that support the domain and data layers. Logging is a critical infrastructure component that should be available throughout the application.

## Structure

- Services that provide logging capabilities
- Structured logging implementations
- Environment-specific loggers

## Migration Notes

This directory will contain logging services migrated from `core/logging/` as part of the architecture improvement plan.
