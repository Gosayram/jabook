# Infrastructure Layer - Error Handling

This directory contains infrastructure-level error handling services.

## Purpose

The infrastructure layer provides cross-cutting concerns that support the domain and data layers. Error handling is a critical infrastructure component that should be available throughout the application.

## Structure

- Error types and failure classes
- Error handling utilities
- Error reporting services

## Migration Notes

This directory will contain error handling services migrated from `core/errors/` as part of the architecture improvement plan.
